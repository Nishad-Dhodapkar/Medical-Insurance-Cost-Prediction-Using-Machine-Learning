Medical Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview
This project aims to predict medical insurance costs using machine learning techniques. The goal is to assist insurance companies in estimating the medical expenses of individuals based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, region, and number of dependents.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, consisting of [number_of_entries] entries with [number_of_features] features. The features include:

Age
Sex
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Smoking status
Region
Children
Charges (target variable)
Machine Learning Models
We experimented with several machine learning algorithms for regression tasks, including:

Linear Regression
Lasso regression
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Support Vector Regressor
K Neighbors Regressor

Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the performance of our models, we used R-squared (R2) score

Results
After training and testing the models, we achieved the following results:

Linear Regression: R2 score = 0.7642348545269875
Lasso Regression: R2 score = 0.7642331805740583
Random Forest Regressor: R2 score = 0.850272026016192
XGBoost Regressor: R2 score = 0.8198281593797385

Future Improvements
Explore additional features such as pre-existing conditions and lifestyle factors.
Fine-tune hyperparameters for better model performance.
Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
